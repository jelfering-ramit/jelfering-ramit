## RAM Infotechnology
This is the business account that I use for my work at [RAM Infotechnology](https://www.ram-it.nl/). We are building and maintaining scalable and sustainable architecture for healthcare organizations and support them in focussing on their customers over dealing with the technical elements around it. The human being is central.
